### how do i run it

download cargo (google it)

clone the repo go into it and do `cargo run`

### targets

to put your copy trade targets open targets.csv either username or address must be specified, then amount MUST be a float i.e 1.0 to spend 1$ on each copy of a buy

### authenitcation

dont think you need a polymarket account tbh though i did and just used https://reveal.magic.link/polymarket to get my private key, make sure you have enough usdc.e and poly to cover tx fees and then usdc.e is what will be spent then put that private key into the .env file. you can also set a custom rpc url but if not theres a default public one


### responsibilities

im not responsible for anything, use this at your own risk it is still in development.
